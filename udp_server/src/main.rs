// what is udp?
// UDP is a connectionless protocol. It is known as a datagram protocol because it is analogous to a
// postal service: when the application layer (layer 7 in the OSI model) passes messages to the
// transport layer (layer 4), they are passed to the UDP. The UDP encapsulates that data in a UDP
// datagram. One significant difference between UDP and TCP is that UDP is a connectionless
// protocol. This means that UDP does not establish a connection before sending data. Instead, UDP
// just sends the data without checking to see whether the recipient is ready to receive the data.
// If the recipient is not ready to receive the data, the data is lost. This means that UDP is
// unreliable. However, UDP is faster than TCP because it does not establish a connection before
// sending data. UDP is used in applications where speed is more important than reliability. For
// example, UDP is used in applications such as video streaming, where lost packets donâ€™t matter.
// UDP is also used in applications such as DNS, where the overhead of TCP is not necessary.
